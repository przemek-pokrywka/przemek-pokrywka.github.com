    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After long time of hesitation and exploring the options I&#8217;ve decided to use Octopress as my new platform for blogging. I was fed up with Blogger mainly because the process of editing and configuring of layout wasn&#8217;t transparent for me. Octopress is based on a totally different concepts. Like Unix, it&#8217;s built from small independent parts, that work well with each other. Rake, Jekyll, Git are some of them. For a developer with Java background setup is pretty easy on standard Ubuntu box. I&#8217;ve encountered only one problem not mentioned in the official documentation, yet only because I haven&#8217;t followed the steps exactly. The problem was in the Ruby package. The default Ubuntu package was not enough, I needed to install the dev version (StackOverflow had the answer).
What I like about the new environment is that all content is just plain text files, everything versioned in git. Even configuration of my blog is versioned so I can freely experiment with it and do rollbacks when I don&#8217;t like the result. I&#8217;ve chosen my personal Github pages as the deployment target. That way I&#8217;m taking one aspect of my life out of Google, on which I already depend more than I&#8217;d want to. But Octopress lets me publish to any host I prefer, so I got maximum independence on hosting.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty happy with that setup. Let&#8217;s see how will it work.</p>
